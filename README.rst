django-responsive a utility application for building responsive websites
in Django. This tool is meant to complement the use of CSS media queries and
help solve problems with fixed width elements such as advertisements or embedded video.

This project does *not* match devices based on user agent strings and instead
uses a small piece of javascript to make the device window size available on the server.
Once enabled you can access a ``device_info`` dictionary in your templates::

    {'width': 320, 'type': 'phone', 'height': 480}

Now you and conditionally render content based on the device size or type.


Installation
------------------------------------

django-responsive requires Python 2.6 or 2.7 and django>=1.3. It is easiest to 
install django-responsive from PyPi using pip::

    pip install django-responsive


Configuration
------------------------------------

To enable django-responsive you will need to update your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` and
``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` settings.::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        # Other middleware classes go here
        'responsive.middleware.DeviceInfoMiddleware',
    )

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        # Other context processors included here
        'responsive.context_processors.device_info',
    )

Note that ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` is not included in the default settings
and you should be careful to not lose the defaults when adding this additional
context processor.

There is an optional setting ``RESPONSIVE_BREAKPOINTS`` which is
used to determine the ``type`` included in the ``device_info`` dictionary. The
default breakpoints are::

    # Name, Max Width (inclusive)
    DEFAULT_BREAKPOINTS = {
        'phone': 480,
        'tablet': 767,
        'desktop': None,
    }
